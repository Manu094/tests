This project was used extensively to practice the CSS box model and general styling. Though I am very proud of it, I am not planning on adding any more content to it as of right now.

note: I did try my hands at a bit of Tailwind, but didn't end up liking it and came back to some good old semantic CSS

note 2 : repo is a mess cuz I am dumb and lazy
